# 👋 Hi, I'm Drishti Bansal  
### Exploring the synergy between Technology, Math, and Art

Welcome to my portfolio — a space where logic meets aesthetics, and data becomes a medium of expression.

I’m passionate about:
- 🧠 Mathematical modeling & statistics  
- 💻 Machine learning and AI  
- 🎨 Visual storytelling through data and design  
- 📊 Turning raw data into intuitive, interactive experiences
